The "Number Guesser" project is a JavaScript-based game where players compete against the computer to guess a randomly generated target number. The game involves several key functions that manage the game's logic, including generating the target number, comparing guesses, updating scores, and advancing rounds. 

### Key Features:
- **Random Target Generation**: At the start of each round, a random target number between 0 and 9 is generated.
- **Guess Comparison**: The player's and computer's guesses are compared to the target number to determine the winner. If both guesses are equally close, the player wins.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of scores for both the player and the computer, updating them based on the outcome of each round.
- **Round Advancement**: After each round, the game advances to the next round, updating the round number displayed to the player.

### Objective:
The objective of the game is to correctly guess the target number or be closer to it than the computer. The game continues for multiple rounds, allowing players to see their scores and progress.

This project provides an opportunity to practice JavaScript functions, conditionals, and basic game logic, while also interacting with HTML and CSS to create a simple web-based game interface.
