{"purpose":[{"description":"Your code successfully implements the core functions needed for the Number Guesser game. The `generateTarget`, `updateScore`, and `advanceRound` functions are correctly defined and fulfill their intended purposes."},{"description":"The `compareGuesses` function has a small issue with variable names. Ensure that the parameters `player`, `computer`, and `number` are used correctly within the function. The variables `targetNumber`, `humanGuess`, and `computerGuess` are not defined within the function scope.","old_code":"const compareGuesses = (player, computer, number) => {\n const humanDifference = Math.abs(targetNumber - humanGuess);\n  const computerDifference = Math.abs(targetNumber - computerGuess);","new_code":"const compareGuesses = (humanGuess, computerGuess, targetNumber) => {\n const humanDifference = Math.abs(targetNumber - humanGuess);\n  const computerDifference = Math.abs(targetNumber - computerGuess);"}],"readability":[{"description":"Your code is well-structured and easy to follow. The use of arrow functions and consistent indentation enhances readability."},{"description":"Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each function. This will make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the code in the future.","old_code":"const generateTarget = () =>{\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)\n}","new_code":"// Generates a random target number between 0 and 9\nconst generateTarget = () =>{\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)\n}"}],"performance":[{"description":"The use of `Math.abs()` in the `compareGuesses` function is a good choice for calculating the absolute difference, ensuring accurate comparisons."},{"description":"Consider adding input validation to ensure that the human guess is between 0 and 9. This can prevent potential errors if the user inputs an invalid number.","old_code":"const compareGuesses = (humanGuess, computerGuess, targetNumber) => {","new_code":"const compareGuesses = (humanGuess, computerGuess, targetNumber) => {\n  if (humanGuess < 0 || humanGuess > 9) {\n    alert('Your guess is out of range!
